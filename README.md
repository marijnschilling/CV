# Marijn Schilling - iOS Developer

I love writing code that is easy to read and easy to manage, for others and my future self. 

## Work Experience

### Bakken&Baeck | Amsterdam | June 2016 - current
#### iOS Developer
At bakken & Baeck I became part of an international team of skilled developers. Next to developing apps for big clients, we work on creating our own [frameworks](https://github.com/UseSweet) and [iOS-handbook](https://github.com/bakkenbaeck/iOS-handbook).

**Main projects**: [Coinbase Wallet](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinbase-bitcoin-wallet/id886427730?mt=8), [Daylight](https://daylight.today/)

### Fonk | Amsterdam | August 2014 - May 2016 | Amsterdam
#### iOS Developer
At Fonk I started to work more independently on projects and learned to work closely together with back end developers and designers.
